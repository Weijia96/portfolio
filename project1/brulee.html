        <h1 style=font-size:70px>Crème Brûlée</h1>
        <p>Brûlée is a dessert consisting of a rich custard base topped with a texturally contrasting layer of hardened caramelized sugar. It is normally served slightly chilled; the heat from the caramelizing process tends to warm the custard producing a cool center. The custard base is traditionally flavored with vanilla&rsquo; but can have a variety of other flavorings.</p>

                <figcaption>Add Cream. For this recipe&rsquo; we need 2 cups of cream. We like to use 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of half and half. For a richer crème brûlée&rsquo; use 2 cups heavy cream&rsquo; or to make it a bit lighter&rsquo; use 2 cups of half and half.

                        Add the cream and whisk until fully blended.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>Begin Lightly Torching the Sugar. Hold the torch a good distance away from the Creme Brulee and slowly move it closer&rsquo; while sort of rotating the flame&rsquo; keeping it constantly in motion. Once it gets close enough&rsquo; you'll see the sugar start to liquefy and form little droplets on the surface.</figcaption>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
            <li><strong>Place the cream</strong>&rsquo;vanilla bean and its pulp into a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat&rsquo; cover and allow to sit for 15 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean and reserve for another use. </li>
            <li><strong>In a medium bowl</strong>&rsquo;whisk together 1/2 cup sugar and the egg yolks until well blended and it just starts to lighten in color. Add the cream a little at a time&rsquo; stirring continually. Pour the liquid into 6 (7 to 8-ounce) ramekins. Place the ramekins into a large cake pan or roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake just until the creme brulee is set&rsquo; but still trembling in the center&rsquo; approximately 40 to 45 minutes. </li>
            <li><strong>Remove</strong> the ramekins from the roasting pan and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 3 days. Remove the creme brulee from the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes prior to browning the sugar on top. Divide the remaining 1/2 cup vanilla sugar equally among the 6 dishes and spread evenly on top. Using a torch&rsquo; melt the sugar and form a crispy top. Allow the creme brulee to sit for at least 5 minutes before serving.</li>
